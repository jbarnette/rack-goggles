= Rack Goggles

* http://github.com/jbarnette/rack-goggles

== Description

See a "pretty" version of your API.

Goggles installs a little tiny Sinatra app on a URL prefix and serves
any JSON responses that come back as a prettyprinted HTML
page.

This could be a lot fancier and prettier, I just extracted the bare
minimum from a production app. Patches welcome.

== Examples

    require "rack/goggles"
    use Rack::Goggles, "/goggles"

Let's pretend your app has a <tt>users</tt> resource available at
<tt>http://example.org/api/v3/users</tt>. With Goggles configured as
above, hitting <tt>http://example.org/goggles/api/v3/users</tt> will
give you a prettified version.

Goggles ignores any response that doesn't have an
<tt>application/json</tt> content type.

== Installation

    $ gem install rack-goggles
